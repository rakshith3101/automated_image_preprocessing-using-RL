# automated_image_preprocessing-using-RL
Have you ever struggled to pick the best preprocessing hyperparameters for your classification model!?ü§î
TADA!! Here you go, this project will definitely help u choose your next hyperparameter right.
This project is built on reinforcement learning approach where we have environments derived from openAI gym. With the right proportion of algorithm and craziness we could deliver an accurate model that could help your deep leanring model to predict better.
